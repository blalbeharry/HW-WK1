In this assignment, some of the original HTML source code was altered to semantic tags. There was some issue with regards to making everything identification wise consistent between html and css documents.
I encountered errors at first with improper changes between semantic and <div> tags when it came to the layout of the finished website design compared to the intended formatting.
The semantic tags were used throughout to clarify and aid in accessibility features for the website host.
